## devicetree.org logo use

TL;DR: Linaro approves of using the devicetree.org logo in this app.
Note that we neither endorse Linaro nor the devicetree.org website, and dtvis is
not affiliated with either. Below is the exchange via Linaro's service desk.

Hello,

I have a project that visualizes device trees (given as DTB files):
https://github.com/platform-system-interface/dtvis

I would like to add the DeviceTree logo to it, though I am not sure what its license is.

The spec has a chapter on licensing:
https://devicetree-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/license.html
However, it does not make it clear to me if and how I can use the logo, saying "The Linaro and devicetree.org word marks and the Linaro and devicetree.org logos and related marks are trademarks and service marks licensed by Linaro Ltd."
Further below, a general statement says (without further reference):
"Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0"
Does that include the logo? Given that the spec is a document and the logo is an image, I would have expected a creative commons license.

The dtvis project itself is currently MIT licensed, though that can be changed if necessary.
If you are interested in it, I'll be happy to cooperate and work out some ideas. :slight_smile:

Regards
Daniel
